I use Pixel C tablet AVD with api 30.

The way to use this pdf viewer is simple. You can click on the button on the toolbar. If you want to pan or zoom, click the click(cursor) button.If you want to erase, click eraser button. If you want to draw with pen, click on the pen. Draw with highligher, click on the highliter.The name of the file is in title and the page is in status bar at bottom. Next for next page, prev for previous page. Redo for redoing, undo for undo. It is pretty obvious.

When you erase, you should make sure you are at the line exactly. (You can click the line you need to erase mutiple times to solve this problem)
Thanks
